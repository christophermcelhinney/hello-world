# hello-world
I am a creative with a fine art degree who did a frontend web design course (CIW).
I've done the first Oracle database module.
Working by myself I installed WAMP and have managed to get PHP talking to the database.
I am currently learning Javascript and though I want to build a basic E-Commerce site, frontend is what I want to do.
I have done a couple of single page designs for some self-employed people that were published. 
I regard myself as at student level.
